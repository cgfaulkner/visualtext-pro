Import and reference fixes — Task F, 2026-01-27
================================================

CHANGES MADE
------------
1. shared/path_validator.py — get_allowed_base_dirs():
   - Replaced hardcoded "Slides to Review", "Reviewed Reports", "Temp", "Slide Thumbnails" with canonical names: documents_to_review, reviewed_reports, temp, slide_thumbnails, archive.
   - Added comment: project_root allows any path under repo; canonical runtime folders listed explicitly.
   - TODO added: prefer loading allowed base dirs from config.yaml (see docs/cleanup-summary.md).

2. core/pptx_batch_processor.py (line 52–53):
   - Default input_folder: 'Slides to Review' → 'documents_to_review'.
   - Default output_folder: 'Reviewed Reports' → 'reviewed_reports'.

3. AGENTS.md:
   - "Slides to Review/" → "documents_to_review/" in Project Layout.
   - Sample path "Slides to Review/test1_llava_latest_backup test names.pptx" → "documents_to_review/test1_llava_latest_backup test names.pptx".

NO CODE IMPORTS of core/backup, old_project, or visualtext_pro — verified; none updated (none existed in active tree).

DRY-RUN
-------
Command: python3 altgen.py --dry-run process "documents_to_review"
Output: Error: No module named 'yaml' (PyYAML not installed in environment). Re-run after: pip install -r requirements.txt

PYTEST
------
Not run (no tests/ directory in repo; CI references tests/fixtures/selector/... which are missing).
