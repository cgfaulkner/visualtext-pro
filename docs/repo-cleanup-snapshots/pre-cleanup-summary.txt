Pre-cleanup summary — 2026-01-27
================================

INVENTORY VS FILESYSTEM MISMATCHES
----------------------------------
1. docs/: Inventory lists 2 files (repo-inventory.md, smart-selector-contract.md).
   Actual has 5 files. Extra: batch-operational-resilience.md, batch-processing-audit.md, batch-processing-remediation-plan.md.

2. .claude_docs/: Inventory lists 4 files. Actual has 5 files.
   Extra: phase_2b1_enhancement_complete.md.

3. .github/workflows/: Inventory lists 1 file (validate-selector-schema.yml).
   Actual has 2 files. Extra: python-app.yml.

4. tests/: Inventory describes tests/ tree with test_selector.py and fixtures.
   tests/ is ABSENT in the repo (no tests/ directory or test_*.py files found).

5. Root: Inventory lists BATCH_PROCESSING_REVIEW.md at repo root.
   BATCH_PROCESSING_REVIEW.md is not present at repo root.

6. Section 4 "selector_manifest" table (repo-inventory.md ~lines 210–213):
   References visualtext_pro/selector/selector.py — STALE. Implementation lives in shared/selector/selector.py.


NOTABLE SURPRISES
-----------------
- tests/ directory is missing; CI (.github/workflows/validate-selector-schema.yml) references tests/fixtures/selector/... — those paths do not exist, so the workflow would fail if run.
- BATCH_PROCESSING_REVIEW.md is in inventory but not on disk.
- Documents to Review, Slides to Review, Complete/, Temp/ are in .gitignore and may exist only as local directories; they are not visible in the tracked repo.


SCREENSHOTS TO CAPTURE
-----------------------
Capture via Finder or VS Code and save in this folder (docs/repo-cleanup-snapshots/):
- Repo root
- core/
- shared/
- Documents to Review (if it exists)
- Documents_to_Review (if it exists)
- Slides to Review (if it exists)
- Complete/ (if it exists)
- Temp/ (if it exists)
