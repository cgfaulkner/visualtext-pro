# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to the project maintainers. Use one of these options:

- Open a [private security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories) on this repository (preferred when the repo supports it).
- Or contact the maintainers via the repository’s preferred contact method. <!-- TODO: Add an official contact, e.g. security@YOURDOMAIN, if one exists. Do not add personal email addresses. -->

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive findings.

## In-scope

We consider the following in scope for security reports:

- Credential or secret exposure (e.g. keys, tokens, passwords in code or config)
- Arbitrary file read or write outside intended paths
- Command injection, code injection, or unsafe deserialization
- Issues that could lead to denial of service in normal deployment

## Out-of-scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities for this project:

- General usage questions, feature requests, or support needs — please use [Issues](https://github.com/cgfaulkner/visualtext-pro/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/cgfaulkner/visualtext-pro/discussions) instead.
- Problems that require an already-compromised local account or physical access to the machine running the tool.
